# fretgenerator360
Fretboard generator for guitarbuilders in Fusion360

Author: www.Audiohotshot.nl

Purpose:
This Addin for Fusion360 is meant for making fretboards for guitars.

Version:
It still is in big, big Beta-phase as it contains no validationcheck on negative or insane big numbers, yet. 

Know issues: no validationcheck on negative or insane big numbers, yet. So just use realistic numbers and you'll be fine.

You can enter the scale of the fretboard; it wil draw the whole board including the frets. It also draws the line for the tremolo-part 
so you know what (when slanted) the exact direction of the trem is. The plugin also draws a construction centre line. The whole fretboard is drawn on the centre of the x-axis.



Options:

Scale high - holds the scale for normal scales.

Slanted - will reveal the options for slanted fretboards

Scale low - holds the scale for slanted fretboards

Centre fret - holds the fretnumber which will be the centre of the slanted board

Number of frets - the amount of frets the boards will have (max 36)

Width - the width of the fret board

Show dots - will reveal and draw the positiondots

Diameter - the diameters of the dots


This was developed on a Mac running Fusion360 and Spyder2
