Author: www.Audiohotshot.nl

Purpose:
This Addin for Fusion360 is meant for making fretboards for guitars.

Version:
It still is in Beta-phase as it contains no validationcheck on negative or outrages big numbers, yet.

You can enter the scale of the fretboard; it wil draw the whole scale including the frets. It also draws the line for the tremolopart 
so you know where (when slanted) the exact position of the trem is.

Options:

Scale high - holds the scale for normal scales.

Slanted - will reveal the options for slanted fretboards

Scale low - holds the scale for slanted fretboards

Centre fret - holds the fretnumber which will be the centre of the slanted board

Number of frets - the amount of frets the boards will have (max 36)

Width - the width of the fret board

Show dots - will reveal and draw the positiondots

Diameter - the diameters of the dots


This was developed on a Mac running Fusion360 and Spyder2
